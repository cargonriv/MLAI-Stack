# Demo Pages Update

## Overview
Successfully moved the three interactive ML demos from embedded components in the Showcase page to separate dedicated subpages for better user experience and navigation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Demo Pages
- `src/pages/demos/ImageClassification.tsx` - Grounded SAM object detection demo
- `src/pages/demos/SentimentAnalysis.tsx` - BERT sentiment analysis demo  
- `src/pages/demos/MovieRecommendation.tsx` - Collaborative filtering recommendation demo

### 2. Updated Routing
- Added new routes in `src/App.tsx`:
  - `/demos/image-classification`
  - `/demos/sentiment-analysis` 
  - `/demos/movie-recommendation`

### 3. Enhanced Navigation
- Updated `src/components/Header.tsx` to include:
  - Desktop dropdown menu for "Demos" with all three options
  - Mobile navigation section for demo pages
  - Proper accessibility attributes and keyboard navigation

### 4. Modified Model Cards
- Updated `src/components/ModelCard.tsx` to support both:
  - Legacy embedded demos (via `demoComponent` prop)
  - New separate demo pages (via `demoUrl` prop)
- Cards now link to dedicated demo pages instead of expanding inline

### 5. Updated Showcase Content
- Modified `src/components/ModelsSection.tsx` to:
  - Remove embedded demo components
  - Add `demoUrl` properties pointing to new demo pages
  - Update description to mention dedicated demo environments

## Benefits

- **Better Performance**: Demos load only when specifically requested
- **Cleaner Navigation**: Clear separation between overview and hands-on experience
- **Mobile Friendly**: Better mobile experience with full-screen demo interfaces

### Technical Benefits
- **Code Organization**: Demos are now properly separated into their own pages
