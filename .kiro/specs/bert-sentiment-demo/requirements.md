# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement a BERT sentiment analysis demo that integrates seamlessly with the existing MLAI-Stack portfolio website. The demo will provide real-time sentiment analysis of user-provided text through a FastAPI backend service and an interactive React frontend component, following the same architectural patterns as the existing Grounded SAM demo.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor to the portfolio website, I want to analyze the sentiment of text input, so that I can see a live demonstration of BERT-based natural language processing capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to the sentiment demo section THEN I SHALL see a text input area for entering text
2. WHEN I enter text in the input area THEN the system SHALL accept text input up to reasonable limits
3. WHEN I click the analyze button THEN the system SHALL process the text and return sentiment results
4. WHEN the analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL display the sentiment label (positive/negative/neutral) and confidence score
5. WHEN the analysis is processing THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer reviewing the portfolio, I want the sentiment analysis to use industry-standard BERT models, so that I can evaluate the technical implementation quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend starts THEN it SHALL load a Hugging Face BERT sentiment analysis pipeline
2. WHEN text is submitted for analysis THEN the system SHALL use the pre-loaded BERT model for inference
3. WHEN returning results THEN the system SHALL provide both sentiment label and numerical confidence score
4. IF the model fails to load THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling and fallback messaging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the sentiment demo to work consistently across different screen sizes, so that I can use it on mobile, tablet, or desktop.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the demo on mobile devices THEN the interface SHALL be fully responsive and usable
2. WHEN I access the demo on different browsers THEN the functionality SHALL work consistently
3. WHEN the text input is long THEN the textarea SHALL handle multi-line input appropriately
4. WHEN displaying results THEN the layout SHALL adapt to different screen sizes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the sentiment analysis backend to integrate with the existing FastAPI infrastructure, so that deployment and maintenance remain consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend starts THEN it SHALL expose an `/api/sentiment` endpoint
2. WHEN receiving POST requests THEN the endpoint SHALL accept JSON with text field
3. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL return JSON with label and score fields
4. WHEN deployed THEN the API routing SHALL work correctly in both development and production environments
5. IF errors occur THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor, I want the sentiment demo to follow the same design patterns as other demos, so that the user experience is consistent across the site.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the sentiment demo THEN it SHALL use the same UI components and styling as other demos
2. WHEN I interact with the demo THEN the loading states and animations SHALL match the existing design system
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the error handling and messaging SHALL follow the same patterns as other components
4. WHEN the demo loads THEN it SHALL integrate seamlessly with the existing page layout and navigation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer examining the codebase, I want the sentiment demo implementation to follow the established code organization patterns, so that the code remains maintainable and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the frontend code THEN the component SHALL be located in the appropriate directory structure
2. WHEN examining the backend code THEN it SHALL follow the same patterns as existing API endpoints
3. WHEN looking at the proxy configuration THEN it SHALL route `/api/sentiment` correctly in all environments
4. WHEN testing the implementation THEN it SHALL include appropriate unit and integration tests
5. WHEN deploying THEN the build process SHALL handle the new components without additional configuration
