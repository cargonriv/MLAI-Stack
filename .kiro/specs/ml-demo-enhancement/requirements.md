# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves replacing the current mock/placeholder implementations in the ML demo components with actual, functional machine learning models. Specifically, this includes implementing real BERT-based sentiment analysis and authentic collaborative filtering for movie recommendations using matrix factorization techniques (ALS, SVD) and trained deep neural networks. The goal is to transform the portfolio from a visual showcase into a fully functional ML demonstration platform that runs client-side inference with real models.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor testing the sentiment analysis demo, I want to experience real BERT model inference, so that I can see authentic natural language processing capabilities in action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters text into the sentiment analysis demo THEN the system SHALL process it using an actual BERT model loaded via Hugging Face Transformers.js
2. WHEN the BERT model processes text THEN the system SHALL return real confidence scores and sentiment classifications (positive, negative, neutral)
3. WHEN a user submits text for analysis THEN the system SHALL display actual processing time and model performance metrics
4. IF the text is too long for the model THEN the system SHALL handle truncation gracefully and inform the user
5. WHEN the model is loading for the first time THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators for model download and initialization

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a visitor exploring the recommendation system, I want to interact with real collaborative filtering algorithms, so that I can understand how modern recommendation systems work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides movie ratings THEN the system SHALL use actual matrix factorization algorithms (ALS or SVD) to generate recommendations
2. WHEN the collaborative filtering model processes user input THEN the system SHALL return personalized movie recommendations based on real similarity calculations
3. WHEN a user rates multiple movies THEN the system SHALL update recommendations in real-time using the trained model
4. WHEN the system generates recommendations THEN the system SHALL display confidence scores and explanation of why movies were recommended
5. WHEN insufficient ratings are provided THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle cold-start problems with appropriate fallback strategies

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer evaluating the technical implementation, I want to see real model loading and inference performance, so that I can assess the practical viability of client-side ML.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN models are loaded THEN the system SHALL display actual model sizes, loading times, and memory usage
2. WHEN inference is performed THEN the system SHALL show real processing times and throughput metrics
3. WHEN models are cached THEN the system SHALL demonstrate improved performance on subsequent uses
4. WHEN browser compatibility issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options
5. WHEN models fail to load THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to informative error states without breaking the user experience

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user on different devices and network conditions, I want the ML demos to work reliably, so that I can experience the functionality regardless of my technical setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses demos on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL optimize model loading and inference for mobile hardware constraints
2. WHEN a user has a slow internet connection THEN the system SHALL provide progressive loading with clear progress indicators
3. WHEN browser memory is limited THEN the system SHALL manage model memory usage efficiently and provide appropriate warnings
4. WHEN WebGL or other acceleration is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to CPU inference with performance warnings
5. WHEN models are too large for the device THEN the system SHALL offer alternative lightweight models or clear explanations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor interested in ML capabilities, I want to understand the technical details behind the models, so that I can appreciate the complexity and implementation quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views model information THEN the system SHALL display actual model architectures, parameter counts, and training details
2. WHEN inference is performed THEN the system SHALL show intermediate processing steps and attention visualizations where applicable
3. WHEN models produce results THEN the system SHALL provide explanations of how the results were derived
4. WHEN a user wants technical details THEN the system SHALL offer expandable sections with model specifications and performance characteristics
5. WHEN comparing different approaches THEN the system SHALL demonstrate trade-offs between model size, accuracy, and inference speed

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a potential employer or client, I want to see production-quality ML implementation, so that I can evaluate the engineer's ability to deploy real ML solutions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN models are implemented THEN the system SHALL follow ML engineering best practices for model versioning, caching, and error handling
2. WHEN inference pipelines are built THEN the system SHALL demonstrate proper preprocessing, postprocessing, and result validation
3. WHEN performance optimization is needed THEN the system SHALL show techniques like model quantization, batching, and efficient memory management
4. WHEN edge cases occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully with appropriate logging and user feedback
5. WHEN demonstrating scalability THEN the system SHALL show how the implementation could extend to production environments
