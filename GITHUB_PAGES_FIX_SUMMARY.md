# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. API Authentication Errors (405 Method Not Allowed)
**Problem**: Your GitHub Pages site was trying to make API calls to `/api/auth/register` and `/api/auth/login`, but GitHub Pages only serves static files and doesn't support backend APIs.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `src/services/api.ts` to use Supabase authentication instead of custom API endpoints
- Replaced `fetch` calls to backend with Supabase auth methods:
  - `login()` now uses `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword()`
  - `register()` now uses `supabase.auth.signUp()`
- Added mock data for movie recommendations and user profiles to work without a backend

### 2. CSS Loading Issues
**Problem**: The build process wasn't optimized for GitHub Pages deployment.

**Solution**:
- Updated build configuration in `vite.config.ts`
- Created `.env.production` file with proper environment variables
- Added `public/404.html` for GitHub Pages SPA support
- Updated deployment script to use production build

### 3. Component Data Structure Mismatch
**Problem**: The `RecommendationDemo` component expected a `ratings` property that wasn't being returned by the updated API service.

**Solution**:
- Updated `getProfile()` function to return mock ratings data that matches component expectations
- Added proper TypeScript types to prevent future issues

## Files Modified

1. **src/services/api.ts** - Complete rewrite to use Supabase instead of custom backend
2. **vite.config.ts** - Updated base path configuration
3. **package.json** - Updated deploy script to use production build
4. **.env.production** - Created production environment configuration
5. **public/404.html** - Added GitHub Pages SPA support
6. **deploy-github-pages.sh** - Created deployment script

## Current Status

✅ **Authentication**: Now uses Supabase for user registration and login
✅ **Movie Recommendations**: Uses mock data that works without backend
✅ **CSS Loading**: Fixed build configuration issues
✅ **GitHub Pages**: Properly configured for static hosting
✅ **Deployment**: Successfully deployed to GitHub Pages

## Your Site URLs

- **GitHub Pages**: https://cargonriv.github.io/MLAI-Stack/
- **Custom Domain**: https://cargonriv.com (if configured in GitHub Pages settings)

## Next Steps (Optional Improvements)

### 1. Set up Supabase Database Tables
If you want persistent movie ratings and recommendations:

```sql
-- Create movies table
CREATE TABLE movies (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  genre TEXT,
  year INTEGER,
  rating DECIMAL(3,1)
);

-- Create user_ratings table
CREATE TABLE user_ratings (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  movie_id INTEGER REFERENCES movies(id),
  rating INTEGER CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 2. Enable Row Level Security (RLS)
```sql
-- Enable RLS on user_ratings
ALTER TABLE user_ratings ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policy for users to only see their own ratings
CREATE POLICY "Users can only see their own ratings" ON user_ratings
  FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### 3. Update API Service to Use Real Supabase Queries
Replace the mock data in `src/services/api.ts` with actual Supabase queries once you have the database tables set up.

## Testing

The site should now work properly on GitHub Pages with:
- ✅ User registration and login via Supabase
- ✅ Movie rating functionality (with mock data)
- ✅ Recommendation generation (with mock data)
- ✅ All CSS and assets loading correctly
- ✅ Proper routing for single-page application

## Troubleshooting

If you still see issues:

1. **Clear browser cache** - Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Check GitHub Pages settings** - Ensure source is set to "Deploy from a branch" and branch is "gh-pages"
3. **Wait for propagation** - GitHub Pages can take 5-10 minutes to update
4. **Check browser console** - Look for any remaining errors

The main issues causing the 404 and 405 errors have been resolved by switching from a backend API to Supabase for authentication and using mock data for the demo functionality.
