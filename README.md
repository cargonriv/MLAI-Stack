## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone github.com/cargonriv/MLAI-Stack

# Navigate to project directory
cd MLAI-Stack

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server (frontend only)
npm run dev

# Start full-stack development (frontend + FastAPI backend)
npm run dev:full

# Or start services separately:
# Terminal 1: Start FastAPI backend
npm run dev:backend

# Terminal 2: Start frontend
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## üêç FastAPI Backend

The sentiment analysis demo now includes a dedicated FastAPI backend for server-side BERT inference:

### Backend Features
- **DistilBERT Model**: Fast, accurate sentiment analysis using Hugging Face Transformers
- **Real-time API**: `/api/sentiment` endpoint for instant text analysis
- **Model Information**: `/api/model-info` endpoint with detailed model specs
- **Health Monitoring**: `/api/health` for service status checks
- **CORS Enabled**: Ready for frontend integration

### Backend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start FastAPI server
python main.py
```

### API Usage
```bash
# Test sentiment analysis
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/sentiment" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"text": "I love this product!"}'

# Check API documentation
open http://localhost:8000/docs
```
