# WebLLM Storage Quota Fix

## Problem
The chatbot was failing with `QuotaExceededError: Quota exceeded` when trying to initialize WebLLM with the Phi-3.5 model (~2.4GB), which exceeded browser storage limits.

## Root Cause
- Browser storage quotas are typically 1-2GB for most users
- The Phi-3.5-mini model requires ~2.4GB of storage
- No fallback mechanism for storage-constrained environments

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Model Size Optimization
- **Changed default model** from Phi-3.5 Mini (2.4GB) to Llama 3.2 1B (1.2GB)
- **Reordered model list** by size (smallest first) for better compatibility
- **Added model size estimates** and compatibility checking

### 2. Storage Management
- **Added storage quota checking** before model initialization
- **Implemented automatic fallback** to smaller models when quota exceeded
- **Added storage management UI** in chat settings panel
- **Created cache clearing functionality** to free up space

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Graceful degradation** when WebLLM fails due to storage issues
- **Informative error messages** with actionable suggestions
- **Automatic retry** with smaller models on quota errors
- **Better user feedback** about storage limitations

### 4. Browser Compatibility
- **Storage API detection** for quota checking
- **WebGPU support validation** with fallback messages
- **Cross-browser compatibility** improvements

## Key Changes Made

### `src/utils/webllm.ts`
- Added `DEFAULT_MODEL` constant (Llama 3.2 1B)
- Implemented `checkStorageQuota()` function
- Added `getModelSizeEstimate()` for size validation
- Enhanced `initializeWebLLM()` with quota checking and fallback
- Fixed TypeScript issues with streaming responses
- Added `clearWebLLMCache()` for storage management

### `src/utils/rag.ts`
- Updated default model to Llama 3.2 1B
- Added `checkModelCompatibility()` function
- Enhanced error handling with storage-specific messages
- Improved fallback responses with actionable tips
- Added compatibility ratings for models

### `src/components/AdvancedTokenizedChat.tsx`
- Changed default model selection to Llama 3.2 1B
- Added storage management UI in settings panel
- Implemented `checkStorageStatus()` and `clearModelCache()` functions
- Added storage info display with warnings

## Model Compatibility Matrix

| Model | Size | Compatibility | Use Case |
|-------|------|---------------|----------|
| Llama 3.2 1B | ~1.2GB | High ✅ | Default, best compatibility |
| Gemma 2 2B | ~1.8GB | Medium ⚠️ | Good performance/size balance |
| Phi-3.5 Mini | ~2.4GB | Low ❌ | High performance, may fail |

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Fix
- ❌ Immediate failure with cryptic quota error
- ❌ No fallback or recovery mechanism
- ❌ No user guidance on how to resolve

### After Fix
- ✅ Automatic fallback to compatible model
- ✅ Clear error messages with actionable suggestions
- ✅ Storage management tools in UI
- ✅ Proactive compatibility checking
- ✅ Graceful degradation to fallback responses

## Testing
Created `test-webllm.html` for browser compatibility testing:
- Storage quota checking
- Model compatibility validation
- WebGPU/WebAssembly support detection

## Next Steps
1. Monitor user feedback on model performance vs compatibility
2. Consider implementing progressive model loading
3. Add model preloading options for power users
4. Implement storage usage analytics

## Technical Notes
- Storage quotas vary by browser and user settings
- WebGPU support is required for WebLLM
- IndexedDB is used by WebLLM for model caching
- Cache clearing may require page refresh for full effect
