## Features

### ðŸ¤– Smart Tokenization
- Uses the official GPT-4o tokenizer from Hugging Face Transformers.js
- Real-time token counting for both user input and bot responses
- Demonstrates advanced text processing capabilities

### ðŸ’¬ Interactive Conversations
- Context-aware responses about the portfolio, projects, and ML expertise
- Smooth typing animations and real-time feedback
- Persistent chat history during the session

### ðŸŽ¨ Modern UI/UX
- Sleek chat widget that can be toggled from any page
- Minimizable interface for better user experience
- Gradient styling consistent with the portfolio theme
- Mobile-responsive design

### ðŸ§  Portfolio Knowledge
The chatbot can answer questions about:
- Carlos's machine learning projects and experience
- Technical details about the SIDS prediction model
- Information about the technology stack used
- Explanations of the various ML demos
- General ML and AI concepts

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

1. **ChatBot.tsx** - Dedicated demo page showcasing the chat assistant
2. **ChatWidget.tsx** - Reusable chat component available on all pages
3. **tokenizerTest.ts** - Utility for testing tokenizer functionality

### Key Technologies

- **@huggingface/transformers**: GPT-4o tokenizer integration
- **React 18**: Modern React with hooks and state management
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **Radix UI**: Accessible UI components (ScrollArea, etc.)
- **Tailwind CSS**: Responsive styling and animations

### Tokenizer Integration

```typescript
import { AutoTokenizer } from '@huggingface/transformers';

// Initialize tokenizer
const tokenizer = await AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('Xenova/gpt-4o');

// Tokenize text
const tokens = tokenizer.encode('hello world'); // [24912, 2375]
const tokenCount = tokens.length; // 2
```

## Usage

### Accessing the Chat Assistant

1. **Dedicated Demo Page**: Visit `/demos/chatbot` to see the full demo page
2. **Global Widget**: Click the floating chat button on any page (bottom-right corner)
3. **Model Showcase**: Available as a card in the main models section

### Sample Conversations

Try asking the chatbot:
- "Tell me about your projects"
- "What's your ML experience?"
- "Explain the SIDS prediction model"
- "What technologies are used in this portfolio?"
- "How does the tokenizer work?"
